A simple website that displays your nostr posts

## How this works

There is **no database and no backend**. The site is plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
When someone opens the page it connects directly to public Nostr relays and reads
the posts published by your Nostr account.

**To publish a new post, just post on Nostr as usual.** It appears on the website
automatically — there is nothing to rebuild, upload or deploy.

- Profile, name, picture, banner and bio are all read live from the Nostr profile,
  so editing your profile in any Nostr client updates the website too.
- Posts are cached in the browser, so returning visitors see the site immediately
  while fresh posts arrive in the background.

## Settings

Everything you are likely to change lives in **`assets/config.js`**. Edit that one
file — nothing else needs touching.

```js
var SITE_CONFIG = {
  npub: "npub1…",     // whose posts the site shows
  perPage: 20,        // posts per page
  pages: { topics: true, gallery: true, calendar: true, articles: true,
           mentions: true, about: true },
  relays: [ "wss://nos.lol", … ]
};
```

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npub` | The account the site displays. Paste an `npub1…` key (a bare 64-character hex pubkey also works). |
| `perPage` | How many posts, images or events appear on each page. |
| `pages` | Turns each optional page on or off — see below. |
| `relays` | Which relays to read from. All are queried at once and the results merged, so extra relays only add resilience when one is down. |

If the `npub` is missing or malformed, or the relay list is empty, the site says so
on the page instead of loading blank.

## Pages

The feed of posts is always shown. The rest are optional: set one to `false` in
`pages` and both its tab and its page disappear, with any link to it falling back
to the feed.

| Page | Shows |
|---|---|
| Posts | The feed — three posts across, paginated. Always on. |
| `topics` | Every hashtag found in the posts, and the posts filed under each one. |
| `gallery` | Every image from the posts as a grid, each linking back to its post. |
| `calendar` | Calendar events published by the account ([NIP-52](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/52.md)), upcoming first, past ones dimmed. |
| `articles` | Long-form articles published by the account ([NIP-23](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/23.md)), rendered from Markdown. |
| `mentions` | Posts by other people that tag this account, newest first — filtered by web of trust. |
| `about` | Profile details, Nostr address, Lightning address and public key. |

Turning `calendar`, `articles` or `mentions` off also stops the site asking relays
for that data at all.

### Web of trust

Anyone can tag your account in a post, so an unfiltered mentions page fills up with
spam. This one only shows posts from **accounts you follow**, read from your own
follow list (Nostr [kind 3](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/02.md))
on the relays. Nothing to configure — follow and unfollow in any Nostr client and the
page follows suit.

A tag alone is not treated as a mention either: replies carry a tag for everyone in
the thread whether or not they say anything about them, so the post must actually
name your account in its text.

Two things worth knowing:

- It is your follow list only, not the people *they* follow, so a mention from a
  stranger never appears however well connected they are.
- Until your follow list arrives from a relay the filter is skipped rather than
  applied to nothing, so a slow relay cannot empty the page. On a first visit
  unfiltered mentions may show for a moment before the list lands and trims them.
  Your follow list is cached in the browser and kept there ahead of everything
  else, so return visits filter straight away.

Every listing is paginated — the feed, the posts under a topic, the gallery and the
events — and page numbers live in the address (`#/page/2`, `#/tag/bitcoin/2`,
`#/gallery/3`, `#/calendar/2`, `#/articles/2`, `#/mentions/2`), so any page can be
linked or
bookmarked. Individual posts and articles have their own addresses too
(`#/note/note1…`, `#/article/<id>`).

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | The page shell |
| `assets/config.js` | **Your settings** — npub, pages, relays |
| `assets/app.js` | Connects to relays, fetches posts, renders the page |
| `assets/style.css` | Styling |
| `manifest.webmanifest` | Makes the site installable on phones |
| `.well-known/nostr.json` | NIP-05 verification (used if a custom domain is added) |
| `.nojekyll` | Stops GitHub hiding the `.well-known` folder |
